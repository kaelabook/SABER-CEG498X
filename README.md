# SABER: Secure Autonomous Broadcast for Empire Reconnaissance
## Makaela Bennet, Angelo Chavez, William Harvey, Spencer Mullins, Diego Sanchez

### Project Introduction
Rebel Alliance spies on the Death Star have collected ten images that expose weaknesses of the planet sized craft. 
In order to exfiltrate these images to Rebel forces off the Death Star the images must be discretely transferred to a Rebel controlled server within the Death Star and subsequently served to a mobile application. 
The transfer of the images must be done wirelessly; it must be done without using Wi-Fi, Cellular, or Bluetooth because these methods will arouse suspicion from the Empire forces aboard. 
The image transfer will happen from within an Imperial Lab, where the server is outside of this lab. The server will be at least five meters away from the point of origin for the transfer. 
The transfer itself must be encrypted and happen in less than ten minutes. 

There will be, in addition, a required cyber security aspect. 
The Rebel Alliance has a video from Princess Leia. 
The first half must be available on the mobile application to show the entire galaxy, and the second half must only be shown to Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
This will be completed by using a secure form of authentication. 

The dissemination of this information is critical to the Rebel cause, and to life as a whole. 
This information in the correct hands will be used to ensure the Death Star’s reign of terror comes to an end.
